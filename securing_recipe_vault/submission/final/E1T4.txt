E1T4.txt - Text file identifying 2 poor security practices with justification.


1.WebAppSG opens ingress port 80. But the application does not need port 80. This
  should be closed in the security group.

2.The instance role can access all S3 buckets with all S3 privileges. But the
  application only seem to access 1 S3 bucket, the free recipe and only need
read access to the bucket.

3.The WebAppSG has a rule to allow all incoming connections. This should be removed.
