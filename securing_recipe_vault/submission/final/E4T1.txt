# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1.use key-based authentication instead of password-based.
2.limit the source IP that can issue ssh connections to our instances
3.We can also automatically block malicious IP addresses based on ssh brute force alerts based on the aws references below.
The high level steps:
  A GuardDuty finding is raised with suspected malicious activity.
  A CloudWatch Event is configured to filter for GuardDuty Finding type.
  A Lambda function is invoked by the CloudWatch Event and parses the GuardDuty finding.
  State data for blocked hosts is stored in Amazon DynamoDB table. The Lambda function checks the state table for existing host entry.
  The Lambda function creates a Rule inside AWS WAF and in a VPC NACL.
  A notification email is sent via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. Change the IAM policy of the compromised instance to reduce its capability. In this case, remove its privilege to access
the secret receipe S3. e.g., create modify the policy as below:

      Policies:
        - PolicyName: InstanceRolePolicy-C3
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: 2012-10-17
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: 's3:GetObject'
                Resource: 'arn:aws:s3:::can-c3-free-recipes-122731332455'
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: 's3:ListObject'
                Resource: 'arn:aws:s3:::can-c3-free-recipes-122731332455'


In this scenario, this is ok, but it might have complications if there are other instances using the same IAM role. 


2. An alternative is to add an explicit deny IAM policy on the bucket. E.g. below
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-secret-recipes*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-secret-recipes*/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotLike": {
          "aws:userId": [
            "AROAEXAMPLEID:userid"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
