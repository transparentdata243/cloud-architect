# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
GuardDuty detected two brute force entites. The actor and the target. The actor alert is high severity while the target is low severity

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html
GuardDuty has three data sources. From these 3, it has to use flow logs to detect the brute force attempt.
Because there is no DNS activities and AWS API calls in this SSH brute force, so it can't be DNS logs or CloudTrail logs.
