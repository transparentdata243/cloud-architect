Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Since we use multiple AZs for our database, the minimum RTO in this case should be zero for our service. 
For the outage AZ itself, it is based on Amazon:
"RTO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure can vary from minutes to hours."


Minimum RTO for a single region outage
We need to failover manually for a single region outage. 
The time it takes consists of:
0. the problem appears and the time it takes to trigger the alerts
1. on call person gets the alert message and gets ready after root causing the issue
2. the time it takes to promote the replica to the new master
3. route the traffic to the new endpoint



Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
If one database fails, the RPO is the time it takes for us to route our application requests to the database in another AZ.
This should be minimal and automatic. 


Minimum RPO for a single region outage
RPO is the time it takes to route application requests to the secondary region. It should be minutes.
